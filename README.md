Insert function is used to insert the value in bucket for example a.Insert(30,hi) it will insert the value at the 0th index of the array
Search Function is used to search the value in bucket the bucket you will give the key if the value is in the key than it will give the value other wise it will return key not found for example you will give the key 30 so it will return the value hi
